MPCS 56430 Scientific Computing Final Project - Chess Database Analysis

# Overview
An overview of the project and results can be found at "Shane McVeigh - Final Write-Up.pdf" in the main project repository. This will provide information on the methodology and project results. 

# Steps to re-run
You can re-run the data parsing with any of the files in the main project folder, including average_elo.py, parse.py, and popularities.py. This will probably take a significant amount of time depending on your network speed.

You can then run in the trends folder some of the python files to get specific trend data. This will be a faster analysis than re-getting the data from lichess described above. 
You can view the data I received with my main-folder .txt files or in the popularities folder for my trend data. 

# Questions for analysis:

## Are certain openings more popular at different rating levels? 

## Are some openings gaining or losing popularity?

## Are any time controls gaining or losing popularity? 

## Does playing with white or black matter more at different rating levels? Has this changed over time?

## What is the average rating difference for the winning side?
